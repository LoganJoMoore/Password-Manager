# Password-Manager
This project was created to solidify my understanding of Python. This password manager uses CSV and KEY files to store data that has been encrypted through Cryptographys library's Fernet module while using Pandas as the DataFrame.
# Installation
Installation is very simple. Download the python file and run in your IDE. The main file will create all other CSV and KEY files if needed. Pandas and Cryptography. Fernet will need to be installed using:
1. pip install pandas
2. pip install cryptography
